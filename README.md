# BIO539_finalproject

Title: Descriptive analysis of the effects of cultural cognition and racial background on the performance of a student

The BIO101_project was uploaded to the dataset repository and got loaded into the jupyter note book using the pd.read_excel(), following this path 
(“../BIO539/BIO101_project.xlsx”)

To make our life easier in calling column names, the data was tied by changing column names into shorter versions. 
Further the data columns with numerical values and significance to our study were cleaned by removing null values using dropna method of the pandas package.
